# fsMCP

MCP server providing file system tools via stdio. Gives LLMs the ability to read, write, edit, create, move, delete, list and search the local file system -- all confined to a set of allowed directories, with no path out of the sandbox and no shell.

## Tools

### File System
| Tool | Read-only | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `fs_read` | yes | Read file contents with line numbers |
| `fs_glob` | yes | Find files by glob pattern |
| `fs_grep` | yes | Search file contents with regex |
| `fs_list` | yes | List one directory's immediate contents (non-recursive): name, type, size, mtime |
| `fs_find` | yes | Fast fuzzy filename search (`rg --files` + in-process fuzzy ranking) |
| `fs_write` | no | Write or create files |
| `fs_edit` | no | Find-and-replace string editing |
| `fs_mkdir` | no | Create a directory (recursive by default) |
| `fs_move` | no | Move or rename a file or directory |
| `fs_delete` | no | Delete a file, symlink, or directory |

An `access: read` grant in relay admits only the five `readOnlyHint: true` tools above; `access: write` admits all ten.

There used to be an eleventh tool, `fs_bash` (execute a shell command). It has been removed, not fixed: `allowed_dirs` was never a boundary for an arbitrary shell -- a command reaches any path with or without a `cd` -- so every containment guarantee below was void while it was registered. A sandbox with a shell in it is not a sandbox.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- Optional: ripgrep (`rg`) for fast `fs_grep`/`fs_find` (both fall back to a pure Node.js implementation)

## Build & Install

```bash
./build.sh    # builds, installs to ~/.local/bin/fsmcp, registers with Relay
```

### Code signing (note)

fsMCP isn't codesigned because it runs as `node dist/main.js` via a shell launcher — the Mach-O process at runtime is `node` itself, not anything fsMCP ships. macOS TCC keys file-access prompts off the node binary's cdhash, so a node upgrade can trigger a one-time re-prompt for Files & Folders access. Bundling fsMCP into its own .app would be the only way to make those grants permanently rebuild-stable.

## Directory Scoping

fsMCP restricts every tool above to allowed directories. Two sources:

1. **Relay per-token context** -- Relay discovers fsMCP's `contextSchema` during handshake and renders directory configuration in the Settings UI per token. Configured directories are injected as `_meta.allowed_dirs` on each tool call.
2. **CLI flags** -- `--allowed-dir /path` (repeatable) for standalone mode.

If neither is configured, every tool call is refused. Emptiness is never read as "unrestricted" -- an absent or empty scope means deny, on both the CLI and the `_meta` side. Running `fsmcp` with no `--allowed-dir` and no Relay context is therefore a server that answers every call with an error, not one with the run of the filesystem.

```bash
# Standalone with directory restriction
fsmcp --allowed-dir /Users/me/projects/myapp

# Standalone, deliberately unrestricted (must be spelled out explicitly --
# there is no flag or default that means "no restriction")
fsmcp --allowed-dir /
```

### `_meta` may only narrow the CLI grant, never widen it

When fsmcp is run with `--allowed-dir` **and** a caller supplies `_meta.allowed_dirs` on a call, the effective scope is their **intersection**: each `_meta` directory is kept only if it resolves inside one of the `--allowed-dir` roots, and any that don't are dropped (and reported back on the result, not silently). `_meta.allowed_dirs` is treated as caller-supplied input, the same as any other argument on the wire -- fsmcp does not assume anything upstream of it (relay, or whatever configured relay) has already enforced a boundary, so it never lets `_meta` grant more than the operator already typed on the command line:

| `--allowed-dir` (CLI) | `_meta.allowed_dirs` | effective scope |
|---|---|---|
| set | set | intersection (narrowed CLI grant) |
| set | absent | CLI dirs, unchanged |
| absent | set | `_meta` dirs (relay-mediated mode -- the whole grant lives in relay's context) |
| absent | absent | empty, i.e. deny all |

`--allowed-dir /` combined with a caller-supplied `_meta.allowed_dirs: ["/"]` therefore stays confined to whatever narrower scope was actually intersected in -- `_meta` cannot use a `/` (or any other directory outside the CLI grant) to escape it.

### A symlink out of the sandbox is refused, even one a human placed

A symlink that lives inside an allowed directory but resolves outside it is
refused -- on read, on write, and in the output of every search tool. This
holds whoever created the link and however deliberately.

The tempting reading is that a link someone put there by hand is an
intentional grant, and should be followed. It is not treated as one, for two
reasons.

**Symlinks appear in a directory tree without anyone deciding.** `npm install`
creates them throughout `node_modules/.bin`, git checkouts carry them,
extracting a tarball restores them. "A human put it there" describes far less
of the real population of links in a working directory than it sounds like it
does, and nothing distinguishes the deliberate ones at the point the traversal
is checked.

**It would cost `allowed_dirs` its meaning.** Right now that field is the
complete answer to *what can this client reach* -- an operator can read a
grant and know. Following links makes the answer the transitive closure over
whatever links happen to exist, which changes underneath the operator without
any edit to the grant. Relay's own rule is that injecting a scope an MCP does
not enforce is worse than no scope at all, because the UI then asserts a
confinement that does not exist.

So there is no flag for it, and adding one would need to answer both points
above. The capability people actually want here -- *that other directory
should be reachable too* -- is already spelled `allowed_dirs`: list the target
directory alongside the first. That is reviewable in the profile, visible in
the audit log, enforced by the same code path, and it cannot drift when a
package manager creates a link.

fsMCP also cannot *create* a symlink: its entire mutating syscall surface is
`writeFileSync`, `mkdirSync`, `unlinkSync`, `renameSync` and `rmSync`, which
`tests/no-link-primitive.test.js` asserts against the source tree. A client
therefore cannot plant its own escape hatch and then walk through it --
every hop of which would have been correctly validated on the way out.

## Configuration

### With Relay (recommended)

`build.sh` handles registration. Manual:

```bash
relay mcp register --name fsMCP --command ~/.local/bin/fsmcp
```

fsMCP declares a **v2** relay context schema (`contextSchemaVersion: 2`, `source: "operator"`, `scope: "restrict"`, `applies_to: ["fs_*"]`, `enumerable: false`) so relay can offer `allowed_dirs` as an operator-typed field on both local and **remote** access profiles -- a v1 schema (the old `allowed_dirs` field with no version and a directory-list `ui` hint) only works for a local project, because v1 derives the value from a project path a remote profile does not have. Configure per-token directory access in Relay's Settings > Security > Token Permissions.

### Standalone

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fsmcp": {
      "command": "~/.local/bin/fsmcp",
      "args": ["--allowed-dir", "/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```
